# Audio Visualizer

## Audio Spectrum
The audio spectrum is the audible frequency range at which
humans can hear (20Hz - 20,000Hz);

## Pitch & Frequency
Sound waves vibrate at different rates measured in hertz (Hz).
Lower frequencies create lower pitches while higher frequencies create higher pitches.

Frequency and pitch are related but distinct concepts. Frequency is the physical 
measurement of sound wave vibrations per second, while pitch is how we perceive those frequencies.

## Treble
Treble in music refers to the highest frequency range of sound,
typically from 4,000 Hz to 20,000 Hz,

## 7 Frequency Bands
Audio Spectrum can be sub divided into 7 frequency bands:

### Sub Bass
- Range 20Hz - 60Hz,
The deep bass produced in this range is usually felt more than it is heard,
providing a sense of power.
It is recommended to apply no or very little equalization boot to this region.

### Bass
- Range 60Hz - 250Hz,
The bass range determines how fat or thin the sound is. The fundamental 
notes of rhythm are centered on this range. Most bass signals in modern 
music tracks lie around the 90-200 Hz range. 

### Low Midrange
- Range 250Hz - 500Hz,
Boosting a signal around 300 Hz adds clarity to the bass and 
lower-stringed instruments. Too much boost around 500 Hz can
make higher-frequency instruments sound muffled.

### Midrange
- Range 500Hz - 2kHz,
The midrange determines how prominent an instrument is in the mix.
Boosting around 1000 Hz can give instruments a horn-like quality. 
Excess output at this range can sound tinny and may cause ear fatigue. 
If boosting in this area, be very cautious, especially on vocals.

### Upper Midrange
- Range 2kHz - 4kHz,
Human hearing is extremely sensitive at the high midrange frequencies,
with the slightest boost around here resulting in a huge change in the sound timbre.
The high midrange is responsible for the attack on percussive and rhythm instruments. 
If boosted, this range can add presence. However, too much boost around the 3 kHz
range can cause listening fatigue.
Vocals are most prominent at this range so as with the midrange, be cautious when boosting.

### Presence
- Range 4kHz - 6kHz,
The presence range is responsible for the clarity and definition of a sound.
It is the range at which most home stereos center their treble control.
Over-boosting can cause an irritating, harsh sound. Cutting in this range makes the 
sound more distant and transparent.

### Brilliance
- Range 6kHz - 20kHz,
The brilliance range is composed entirely of harmonics and is responsible for sparkle
and air of a sound. Boost around 12 kHz makes a recording sound more Hi-Fi.
Be cautious over boosting in this region as it can accentuate hiss and cause ear fatigue.
